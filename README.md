# Proximity
A Completely Open-Source Python Chatroom

## Setting Up
To setup Proximity, just download the latest version of [Proximity.exe](https://github.com/KodeItDEV/Proximity/releases/tag/2.0.0).

Navigate to Server -> Connect, and type in the proper IP and Port to the chat server you'd like to connect to.

To host a server, makes sure [Server,exe](https://github.com/KodeItDEV/Proximity/releases/tag/2.0.0) is located in the same directory as Proximity.exe. Then, in the Proximity client, navigate to Server -> Host and type in the information you'll need.
If you want to host a server locally only, set the ip to '127.0.0.1', and if you want to host the server over the internet set the ip to '0.0.0.0'
