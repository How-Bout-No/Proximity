# Proximity
A Completely Open-Source Python Chatroom
***
## Info
Proximity is a chat program, which was recently completely overhauled to a brand new language, Python 3.6. It allows the user to connect to chat servers hosted by other users, either locally or over the internet.

The source is available to everyone, whether to be adjusted to one's needs or to supply any necessary information to those who need it.

The scripts are released as EXE's as to not require a full client-side installation of Python 3.6, in other words it just creates less hassle, and there's less things to handle or require.

Proximity works right out of the box, immediately prepared to a chat server that you supply it with.
