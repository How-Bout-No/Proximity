# Proximity
A Completely Open-Source Windows CMD/Batch LAN Chatroom


## How It Works:
-This batch program uses basic Windows network sharing to host files on the WiFi/LAN network to all other computers on the same network. As for the application itself, it uses lots of batch plugins and software to achieve the effects it does.

## Setting Up:
-To get started, head over to the 'releases' tab and downloader the Installer.exe. Save it somewhere then run it. Follow the instructions and the program will set everything up for you. If you're hosting the Chat Server, press 'f' for the full installation, but if you're downloading it just for the application, pressing 'a' will only give you the application.

## Usage:
To use Proximity, just open the Chat.cmd file in your installation directory. Proximity will then connect to the LAN server and check for any updates. If you're running a clean install, it is recommended to 'Sign Up' with an account first. These accounts are uploaded to and encrypted on the server, for security.

After signing up, you can either customize your user under the 'Settings' menu or log right in. The 'Settings' menu allows you to either change cosmetic colors or to run the program in debug mode.

Once logged in, Proximity will again connect to the server to ensure connectivity, and will log in to said server.

## Chat Commands:
`.exit` - Exits the program
